      <p>Colour Swap Runner is a fast-paced 3D running game built around timing, focus, and quick reactions. The player runs automatically while you swipe left or right to switch the character’s colour. The challenge is to match your colour with the incoming gates to survive and keep your streak going.
Each level becomes harder with tighter timing, faster gates, and more obstacles, while you collect as many coins as possible to earn all three stars.</p>

<h2 class="ilearn">What I Learned</h2>
<p class="learn">This project helped me understand how to combine input systems, collision detection, and visual 
  feedback to create satisfying and responsive gameplay. I learned how to design responsive player controls  and manage UI systems,
   and implement a character shop with in-game currency. It also helped me understand how to optimize performance and polish the overall player experience in Unity.</p>
