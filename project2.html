         <h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>  
         
      <p>Tyre Champs is a 3D obstacle-based runner where balance, speed, and tyre control decide how far you go.
The player runs using four tyres, and each obstacle can reduce your tyre size, making the run more challenging.
Speed boosts help you move faster through tough sections, but if your speed becomes too low, you won’t reach the finish line.
Every level introduces new obstacles, tricky paths, and higher difficulty — testing your reflexes and tyre management as you push to become the true Tyre Champ.</p>
    <h2 class="res">My Responsibilities</h2>
     <div class="project-content">
  <p class="responsibilities">
    • Created the basic movement system and tyre-change mechanic.<br>
    • Implemented tyre size change mechanics when hitting obstacles.<br>
    • Created obstacle logic that affects speed, tyre size, and difficulty.<br>
    • Made UI for restart, next level, and other screens.<br>
    • Designed win/lose conditions based on player speed and tyre performance.<br>
    • Added sound effects, background music.<br>
    • Optimized gameplay for smooth mobile performance and responsive controls.
  </p>

<h2 class="key">Key Features</h2>
 <div class="project-content">
  <p class="KeyFeatures">
    • Tyre size change system that reacts to obstacles in real time.<br>
    • Speed-based progression where slowing down leads to failure.<br>
    • Level-based obstacle gameplay with increasing difficulty.<br>
    • Clean and minimal UI/UX system (pause, restart, next level, fail).<br>
  </p>
</div>
<h2 class="ilearn">What I Learned</h2>
<p class="learn">This project helped me understand how to design obstacle-based gameplay using tyre mechanics, speed control, and collision interactions. I learned how to manage tyre size changes, implement speed-based fail conditions, and create fast, responsive player movement.
It also improved my skills in building clean UI systems, handling boosts and obstacles, and optimizing the game for smooth mobile performance.</p>
